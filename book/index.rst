   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Owl Numerical Library
=================================================

Owl's full documentation consists of two parts. The first part is a `Tutorial Book` which gives you a brief tour of the overall system with many examples and explanations. This part is mostly written by hand.

The second part is the `API Reference` built automatically from Owl's repository by the `parser` I wrote. You can access both parts from the current entry page.
