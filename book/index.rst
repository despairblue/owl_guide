OCaml Scientific Computing
=================================================

Owl is a dedicated library for scientific and engineering computing. It is designed in the functional programming language OCaml.

The project is based on the on-going research led by Liang Wang in the `Computer Lab <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/>`_. The source code is `{licensed under MIT} <https://github.com/owlbarn/owl/blob/master/LICENSE.md>`_ and hosted on the `{Github Repository} <https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl>`_.



Mission
-------------------------------------------------

Our mission is to impact how we develop future analytical applications by building a high-performance and robust numerical system in functional programming language. The system aims to serve as the de-facto tool for scientific and engineering computing in OCaml.

Owl should fully implement advanced numerical methods, with inherent support for parallel and distributed computing, as well as a complete set of tooling from designing, prototyping, and deploying modern numerical applications. The project provides both researchers and industry programmers a powerful framework to write concise, fast and safe analytical code.

The project should also produce comprehensive learning materials to promote OCaml learning. We hope the project can help more people in learning OCaml by offering them a "numerical path" to functional programming world.



Learning
-------------------------------------------------

The full documentation consists of two parts. You can access both parts from the current page. The first part is a `Tutorial Book` which starts with a brief introductory of the OCaml language followed by a comprehensive tour of the overall system with many examples and explanations. This part is mostly written by hand.

The second part is the `API Reference` built automatically from Owl's repository by the `parser` I wrote. The API Reference cover the important functions and provides links to the source code form many functions in the library.
